=== Google Maps Javascript API V3 with Ruby on Rails

A simple consumption of the Google Maps JavaScript API V3 with Ruby on Rails 3. I couldn't find many tutorials on how to get this done so I made my own.

To use, run:

	rails server

Then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ (or whatever is your local host/development server) and add on ?latitude=NUMBER_HERE&longitude=NUMBER_HERE&zoom=NUMBER_HERE

For instance, to get the map centered on the statue of liberty, navigate to:

	http://127.0.0.1:3000/?latitude=40.6892&longitude=-74.0444
